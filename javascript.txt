javacript will enable us to run script exclusievly on the client web browser.

event driven programing

events like 
   clicks on a button
   click something from a drop down list
   scrolls through a list
   submits a form

add event listeners or event handlers
  so when user clicks a particular thing, we have to configure which functions to run.

Javascript enables us to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) which represents all the elements that happen to be on that page .

document.querySelector('tag')
document.querySelector('#id')
document.querySelector('.class')

as in python we use list we can use same in javascript too.
